/**
 * Title: Single Number
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/description/
 * Problem: Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. 
 * Find that single one
 * 
 * You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.
 * 
 * Example 1: 
 *  Input: nums = [2,2,1]
 *  Output: 1
 * 
 * Example 2: 
 *  Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
 *  Output: 4
 * 
 * Example 3: 
 *  Input: nums = [1]
 *  Output: 1
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
 * -3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
 * Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once
 * 
 * My Approach: 
 * We can do bitwise XOR operation on all number and the number which is different will be
 * the only one to remain a last. That number is the single number which is unique in nums.
